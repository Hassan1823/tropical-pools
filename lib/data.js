From a shallow end bench, tanning ledge, standard hopper (deep end) & free form layout – it includes our popular features compacted into a small frame.`,

Amazingly, this pool only takes up 179 SQFT with outside dimensions of 11′ width & 19′ 10″ length. Therefore, you could situate this design into small backyard spaces or place it strategically in a specific location of a larger backyard. However you situate this free form pool, you’ll enjoy its narrow footprint and ease of maintenance!`,

We are very grateful for our small fiberglass pool category because of the wide breadth of consumers that fit this category. From urban homes to large backyards that want a smaller swimming pool; we can cater to a wide range of clientele.`,
          `This design includes a gorgeous curved set of entry steps and a tanning ledge. We kept the design of this fiberglass pool pretty simple and added a standard hopper with a maximum depth of 4′ 11″. Therefore, if you’re into entertaining, have grandchildren, or want some peace of mind; the “shallow” deep end may be a perfect choice for you. All in all, this is a wonderful pool model that has a lot to offer in its compact design. Contact us for a free estimate today!`,

          `The Ariella is a petite, free-form swimming pool that fits snugly into any backyard with limited square footage. We love this fiberglass swimming pool because of its relaxed features and basic layout. San Juan Pools designed it to contain all of the standard elements that homeowners enjoy. From a shallow end bench, tanning ledge, standard hopper (deep end) & free form layout – it includes our popular features compacted into a small frame.`,
          `The Ariella works exceptionally well for those who live in urban environments with limited yard space. Why? Mainly it’s a petite size. Amazingly, this pool only takes up 179 SQFT with outside dimensions of 11′ width & 19′ 10″ length. Therefore, you could situate this design into small backyard spaces or place it strategically in a specific location of a larger backyard. However you situate this free form pool, you’ll enjoy its narrow footprint and ease of maintenance!`,
